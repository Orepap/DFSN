# PREREQUISITES
```python
numpy
tensorflow.keras
matplotlib
seaborn
```

# USAGE
```python
from DFSN import DFSN

df = "..." # path to the data file
threshold = "..." # path to the correlation file
epochs = # Specify the number of neurons
batch_size
verbose
plot

selected_features = DFSN(df=df, threshold=threshold, epochs=epochs, batch_size=batch_size, verbose=verbose, plot=plot)
```

The code returns a list with the selected features.
